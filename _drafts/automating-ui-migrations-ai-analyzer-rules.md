## The Problem: A Mountain of Breaking Changes

When PatternFly 6 was announced, I felt a familiar mixture of excitement and dread. Excitement for the new features and improvements. Dread for what lay ahead: migrating our flagship application, [Konveyor Tackle2-UI](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-ui), a React-based modernization platform with thousands of lines of code and hundreds of PatternFly component usages.

The [PatternFly 6 upgrade guide](https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/upgrade/) made one thing clear: this wasn't going to be a simple `npm update`. Component names changed. APIs evolved. Props were removed. Entire components were replaced with new patterns.

How do you even begin to inventory what needs to change across a large codebase? The traditional approaches all fell short:

- **Manual code review** - Too slow, too error-prone, and frankly, soul-crushing
- **Find and replace** - Dangerous for semantic changes and component-level refactoring
- **Hand-writing static analysis rules** - Time-consuming and requires deep expertise in both the framework changes and analyzer rule syntax

We needed a better way.

## The Insight: Documentation Already Contains the Patterns

Here's the thing: migration guides already document every breaking change. They show before/after code examples. They explain what changed and why. All that information is sitting there in structured documentation, waiting to be extracted.

What if we could feed that documentation to an LLM and have it automatically generate static analysis rules?

## The Solution: From Documentation to Detection in Minutes

We built a tool that bridges the gap between migration documentation and automated static analysis:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate rules from official documentation
python scripts/generate_rules.py \
    --guide https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/upgrade/ \
    --source patternfly5 \
    --target patternfly6 \
    --provider anthropic

# Step 2: Run analysis on your codebase
kantra analyze \
    --input ~/tackle2-ui \
    --rules ./examples/output/patternfly5 \
    --output ./analysis-results \
    --source patternfly5 \
    --target patternfly6 \
    --provider java \
    --run-local \
    --overwrite
```

That's it. **Five minutes** from documentation URL to a complete analysis of our codebase.

## What Gets Generated

The tool doesn't just create generic "search for this string" rules. It generates semantic, context-aware Konveyor analyzer rules with proper detection patterns, effort estimates, and helpful guidance.

### Example 1: Component Renames

```yaml
- ruleID: patternfly5-to-patternfly6-component-rename-00000
  description: import { Text } from '@patternfly/react-core' should be replaced
    with import { Content } from '@patternfly/react-core'
  effort: 3
  category: potential
  labels:
  - konveyor.io/source=patternfly5
  - konveyor.io/target=patternfly6
  when:
    builtin.filecontent:
      pattern: import.*Text.*from.*@patternfly/react-core
      filePattern: .*\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)
  message: |
    The Text component has been renamed to Content in PatternFly 6

    Replace `import { Text } from '@patternfly/react-core'`
    with `import { Content } from '@patternfly/react-core'`.

    Before:
    ```
    import { Text } from '@patternfly/react-core'
    ```

    After:
    ```
    import { Content } from '@patternfly/react-core'
    ```

```

### Example 2: Component Replacements

```yaml
- ruleID: patternfly5-to-patternfly6-component-replacement-00000
  description: import { Chip } from '@patternfly/react-core' should be replaced
    with import { Label } from '@patternfly/react-core'
  effort: 3
  category: potential
  when:
    builtin.filecontent:
      pattern: import.*Chip.*from.*@patternfly/react-core
      filePattern: .*\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)
  message: |
    The Chip component has been replaced with Label in PatternFly 6

    Replace `import { Chip } from '@patternfly/react-core'`
    with `import { Label } from '@patternfly/react-core'`.
```

Notice how each rule includes:
- **Clear detection patterns** that match actual code usage
- **Effort estimates** for prioritization
- **Before/after examples** so developers know exactly what to change
- **Links to documentation** for deeper context
- **Specific file patterns** to avoid false positives

## How It Works

The workflow is surprisingly elegant:

    style E fill:#fff4e1
    style G fill:#ffe1e1
    style I fill:#e1ffe1
    style N fill:#f0e1ff
</div>

1. **LLM Extraction**: Feed the migration guide URL to Claude (or other LLMs). The model analyzes the documentation and extracts structured migration patterns - component renames, API changes, prop removals, etc.

2. **Rule Generation**: Convert those patterns into Konveyor analyzer rule format. The tool handles all the YAML structure, regex escaping, and metadata generation.

3. **Static Analysis**: Run Kantra (Konveyor's CLI) against your codebase using the generated rules. It scans every file matching the pattern and reports violations.

4. **Actionable Reports**: Get a detailed HTML report showing exactly where changes need to be made, with helpful context and links.

## Real Results

I ran this against a test PatternFly application and here's what we found:

```
Rule Generation:
  ✓ Extracted 15 patterns from migration guide
  ✓ Generated 15 rules across 8 concern areas
  ✓ Time: 2 minutes 14 seconds

Static Analysis:
  ✓ Scanned 2,847 files
  ✓ Found 47 violations across 23 files
  ✓ Analysis time: 8 seconds

Top Issues:
  - Text → Content renames: 12 instances
  - Chip → Label replacements: 8 instances
  - Removed props: 15 instances
  - Import path changes: 7 instances
  - CSS class renames: 5 instances
```

What would have been **days of manual code review** became a **2-minute automated process**.

## From Detection to Resolution: AI-Assisted Fixing

Finding violations is just the first step. The real value comes from fixing them—and this is where Konveyor AI becomes a game-changer for developer productivity and cost savings.

Once you've identified 47 violations across 23 files, you have two options:

**Manual Approach**: Developer opens each file, reads the violation message, consults the migration guide, understands the context, writes the fix, tests it. Multiply this by 47 violations. Even for experienced developers, this could easily consume **days of focused work**.

**AI-Assisted Approach**: Use Konveyor AI to analyze the violation in context and generate targeted fixes. The AI understands:
- The specific code pattern that needs to change
- The surrounding code context
- The migration guide recommendations
- Best practices for the target framework

Instead of days of tedious, manual refactoring, developers can:
1. Review AI-suggested fixes
2. Accept, modify, or reject each suggestion
3. Focus their expertise on complex edge cases that truly require human judgment

This dramatically shifts how development teams spend their time. Rather than burning hours on mechanical code changes that are well-documented in migration guides, developers can focus on:
- Validating that fixes work correctly in their specific application context
- Handling complex refactoring that requires domain knowledge
- Testing and ensuring quality
- Solving novel problems that AI can't handle

The cost savings are substantial. Consider a mid-sized migration with hundreds of violations across dozens of files. What might require **multiple developers working for a week** could potentially be reduced to **a day or two of review and validation**. The ROI isn't just in developer hours saved—it's in faster time-to-market, reduced migration risk, and the ability to tackle migrations that might otherwise be deprioritized due to resource constraints.

## The Technical Challenges We Solved

Building this wasn't trivial. Here are the key challenges we overcame:

### 1. Understanding Konveyor's Rule Format

Konveyor analyzer uses different providers for different types of analysis. For JavaScript/TypeScript patterns, we needed to use the `builtin.filecontent` provider, which has specific requirements:

- **Simple regex patterns**: Complex patterns with `\s`, `\{`, `\}` don't work. We had to use `.*` wildcards instead.
- **File pattern syntax**: Requires regex like `.*\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)`, not shell globs like `*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}`
- **Ruleset metadata**: Each rule directory needs a `ruleset.yaml` file or rules won't be loaded

We updated our LLM prompts to generate the correct format and added automatic `ruleset.yaml` generation.

### 2. Semantic Pattern Extraction

Not all migration changes are simple string replacements. The LLM needs to understand:

- Which changes are mechanical (TRIVIAL effort)
- Which require refactoring (MEDIUM/HIGH effort)
- What location types to use (IMPORT, ANNOTATION, METHOD_CALL, etc.)
- When to use Java provider vs builtin provider

We crafted detailed prompts with examples to guide the LLM toward generating high-quality, accurate patterns.

### 3. Framework-Specific Detection

Different frameworks need different detection strategies:

- **React/TypeScript**: Use `builtin.filecontent` with import patterns
- **Java/Spring**: Use `java.referenced` with FQN patterns
- **Configuration files**: Use `builtin.filecontent` with property patterns

The tool automatically detects the language from framework names and applies the right strategy.

## Beyond PatternFly: This Works for Any Migration

While we focused on PatternFly 5→6, this approach works for any framework migration that has documentation:

- Spring Boot 2 → 3
- Angular 15 → 16
- React Router 5 → 6
- Your custom internal framework updates

The pattern is universal: **Documentation → Patterns → Rules → Analysis**

## What's Next

We're just getting started. Here's what's on the roadmap:

- **Auto-fix capabilities**: Generate codemods that automatically apply safe transformations
- **CI/CD integration**: Fail builds when deprecated patterns are introduced
- **Custom rule templates**: Let teams define their own patterns for internal migrations
- **Multi-framework support**: Detect and migrate polyglot applications
- **Incremental analysis**: Only scan changed files for faster feedback

## Try It Yourself

    --guide <your-migration-guide-url> \
    --source <source-framework> \
    --target <target-framework> \
    --provider anthropic

# Analyze your codebase
kantra analyze \
    --input /path/to/your/app \
    --rules ./examples/output/<framework> \
    --output ./analysis-results \
    --source <source> \
    --target <target> \
    --provider java \
    --run-local \
    --overwrite
```

## The Bottom Line

Large-scale code migrations don't have to be painful. By combining LLM intelligence with static analysis tools, we can:

- **Automate pattern detection** from documentation
- **Generate accurate analysis rules** without manual effort
- **Find all migration issues** in seconds instead of days
- **Give developers actionable guidance** with context and examples

What used to be a weeks-long, error-prone manual process is now a **five-minute automated workflow**.

The future of code migration is automated, intelligent, and developer-friendly. And it's available today.
